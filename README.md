# Lasers - Puzzle Game

## Description

Lasers is a puzzle game developed in Java using JavaFX for the graphical interface. The game is played on a two-dimensional grid, where the player must place different types of blocks to redirect a laser beam and reach all the targets in each level.

This project was developed as part of Practical Work 1, applying concepts of:

- Object-oriented programming

- Graphical interfaces

## Gameplay

- Select a level from the list of available levels.

- Move the blocks (except fixed ones) within the grid to redirect the laser beam.

- Complete the level by reaching all targets with the laser.

- Once the level is completed, choose another level to continue playing.

## Project Architecture

The project follows a layered architecture:

- Game Logic: Contains classes for grid representation, blocks, and laser beam behavior.

- Graphical Interface: Implemented with JavaFX, enabling user interaction through clicks and drag-and-drop mechanics.
